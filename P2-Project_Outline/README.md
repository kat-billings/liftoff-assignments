# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be for a pomodoro timer website. A pomodoro timer is 25 minutes focusing on a task followed by a 5 minute break. After the fourth 25 minute block, the break is for 15 minutes instead of 5. A feature of the website will be allowing users to use tags to label the time spent focusing, and then to see how much time they have spent focusing per day, month and in total in general or on a specific tag. Since this is a productivity tool, this information would be useful for self-reflection, both to see if a user is keeping up with a goal, and for motivation to see how much work they've been doing lately. Using the pomodoro timer technique has been extremely helpful for me lately, specifically with catching up with the last part of LaunchCode, so that's why I thought it would be an intresting project to create.
### Features
- __Login:__ Users can login or logoff. If a user is logged in, they have access to a history page.
- __Pomodoro Timer:__ An adjustable timer. The default is a 25 minute timer. The timer can be used without logging in, but if the user is logged in, they can add tags to the block.
- __Break Timer:__ A timer that does not count towards the day's total. Shows up after a pomodoro timer has ended. Set to five minutes as default, unless the user has just completed thier 4th/8th/12th/etc. pomodoro block of that day, where it will be set to 15 minutes.
- __History:__ Logged in users can track how much time they have spent focusing by day. A graph of the current month will be the default view, but users can choose to see past months, as well.
- __Tags:__ Users can add tags when they start a pomodoro timer to label what they will be working on. The user can filter the history page to see how much time they've spent working on a specific tag.
### Technologies
- Java
- SQL
- Spring Boot
- HTML/CSS
- Thymeleaf
### What I'll Have to Learn
I plan to learn how to use CSS CSS animations, specifically for the timers. I will also be learning how to use SQL to make graphs and to use it effectively with the tag system.
